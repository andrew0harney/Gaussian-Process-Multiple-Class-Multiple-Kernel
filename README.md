Gaussian-Process-Multiple-Class-Multiple-Kernel
===============================================

Matlab implementation of MC-MKL for Gaussian Processes

The files contained in this project are intended to be useful 
for Gaussian process classification/probability estimation.

In particular the Laplace file is an adaptation of the code
provided in Rasmussen's book to the gerneral multi-class multi-kernel
case.


Notes:

a) The code does not implement the most efficient representation or processing of the covariance matrix
as described in the accompanying paper (to follow in later commit)

b) The project is discontinued by the author, so limited time will be spent addressing issues relating to this
work.

Please also refer to to the accompanying license before using any of this code.
